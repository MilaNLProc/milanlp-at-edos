# milanlp-at-edos

This repository contains the code to replicate the experiments of the proposed approach by the MilaNLP team at the EDOS shared task.

**Please consider the repository WIP.**

## Getting Started

Create a Python environment and install the dependencies 

### Data

We do not include data from the shared task or publicly available artifacts. \
To train our models you will need:

- the official dataset from the task organizers (you will eventually need to create a held out validation set);
- the Gab Hate Corpus


## Citation

Please cite out paper if you used our code or referenced our paper.
